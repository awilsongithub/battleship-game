# Battleship-Game
Battleship style game written with vanilla javascript.

# Layout and Design Challenges
revised layout using bootstrap to vertical 2 row design with controls simply aligned below board. experimented with background images for fireButton, messageArea, form, guessInput. failed to implement a downloaded ttf font and reverted to google font. metallic form background was sweet but too heavily weighted layout to bottom right contrasting smooth digital screen feel of the rest of the game."
